# Governance Structure, Level of Decentralization and Plan of Revolution

* The TEA community is governed by a DAO management structure. 
* The TEA Project DAO encourages decentralized decision making through granting voting rights to locked T tokens. 
* All decisions are made by the DAO solely through voting. 

*T and CML are not governance tokens. Only locked T can vote on governance issues.*

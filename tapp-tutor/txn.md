# TXNs

Txns are also called [commands](commands.md), or events. 

A txn is generated by a [back_end_actor](back_end_actor.md) or [blockchain_listener](blockchain_listener.md) and executed in a [state_machine_actor](state_machine_actor.md) to update the [state](state.md).

A txn is the only outside trigger that's able to change the [state](state.md). In other words, all state changes are triggered by txn(s).

## Some examples of txns

Alice sends 10T to Bob. This is a transfer txn.
Every 1000 blocks, we run a clean up of the blockchain storage. This is a [blockchain_listener](blockchain_listener.md) triggered txn. It looks like a cron job.
If the blockchain notices a new TApp is created, then it performs a **generate tapp account** task. Although this is also a [blockchain_listener](blockchain_listener.md) triggered txn, it's not considered to be like a cron job.

## Binary successful or failed execution

A txn can be successfully executed or failed. If it's successful, it may or may not change the state. But if it's failed, it will definitely **NOT** change the state. 

There are **no partially successful txns**. They're either fully successful or totally failed.
